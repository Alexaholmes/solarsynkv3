## How It Works
SolarSynk retrieves solar system data from the cloud, where it's uploaded via your Sunsynk dongle. It has no direct physical connection to your inverter. 

Please note that this add-on only provides sensor data, it does not include pre-built home assistant  cards to display the information.
