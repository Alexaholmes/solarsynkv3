## How It Works
SolarSynk retrieves solar system data from the cloud, where it's uploaded via your Sunsynk dongle. It has no direct physical connection to your inverter. 

*Please note that this add-on only provides sensor data, it does not include pre-built home assistant  cards to display the information.

## Getting Started
This add-on publishes sensor values to Home Assistant entities using the local API, requiring a long-lived access token.

### Creating a Long-Lived Access Token
Click your profile picture in the bottom left of the HA interface. Scroll down to the bottom and generate a long-lived token. The name isn't important for SolarSynk, but the token key isâ€”be sure to copy and save it for later use.
